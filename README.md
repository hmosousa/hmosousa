I am a PhD student at the University of Porto. My research interest is mainly focused on machine learning with a specific focus on natural language processing. In particular, the focus of my current research - and of my PhD - is on the temporal reasoning capabilities of language models. That is, how do language models "understand" and "manipulate" temporal information (I try to be careful with words).  Besides that, I am a deep reinforcement learning `aficionado` despite all its challenging and complex features. 

I am also a research assistant at LIAAD, the AI lab from INESC TEC, where I am frequently associated in some project to build NLP solutions to some practical problems (check out my [webpage](hugosousa.net) to see the latest). As my last ongoing work, I am a teaching assistant of the Machine Learning course at the University of Porto.

My bachelor's is in Physics and my master's is in Applied Mathematics, so we can talk about that if that is of your interest.
